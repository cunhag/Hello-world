Throughout my entire academic life, I have always received grades in every single class I have taken. I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, and I my academic life there was much different from the American one. In 2013, I came to Grand Rapids for an exchange program in High School and the school system was completely different from the Brazilian one. I felt like in Brazil, although we had more classes, and they were more academically challenging the students were more worried about passing the class and not necessarily learning much. In contrary, I thought that American students although were very worried about their grades, a significant number of students were also dedicated to learning and studying. When I started my undergraduate program at Grand Valley, I started to have the mindset that grades are the most important thing, forgetting how important it is to learn the material. My freshman year was solely based on studying to finish the class with an “A”. I wasn’t really focused on my learning experience, but rather I was more focused on the grade I was about to receive. By my sophomore year, in addition to being homesick (missing my family and friends), I also started to become a very anxious person because all I could focus on were my grades and GPA. 
During my years as an undergraduate student, I have had a few classes in which I received an “A” or “A- “, but if you were to ask what I have learned from them I couldn’t tell you. In contrast, I have also had a couple classes in which I have received a “B-“or “C”, which does not really reflect the amount I have learned from it and the passion I developed for the subject. I believe that grades many times create more of a way for students to compete against each other to prove who is better. With that being said, grades have been the focus for most students making it hard to focus on what really matter (the subjects and learning process). If grades were removed from the courses, I would spend more of my time learning the material that I am really interested on and focus more on my learning process. Grades add a lot of pressure on me, therefore if I did not have to only focus on them, I could take my time to study and get more involved with the material. An example of that would be two classes that I have taken that required a lot of writing and reading. In one of them, the professor was not focused as much on grading but rather a collective learning in which we did a lot of discussion in class about different texts we had to read. After those discussions, sometimes we had to write essays or responses to those texts for participation. The other class also required a lot of reading and writing an immediate post for a grade every week. I can say that for the class that we had to write the responses after discussing the texts in class, and without having the “pressure of the grade”, I would pay a lot more attention to the texts and get insights from it. On the other hand, for the other class, I would glance through the texts and briefly write a response just so I could get a grade from it. In conclusion, I believe that without grades students have more freedom and not as much pressure to study what really interests them, and they can actually use their time to focus on what matters the most: learning.
